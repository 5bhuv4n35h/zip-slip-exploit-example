# Zip Slip exploit example

> "Zip Slip is a form of directory traversal that can be exploited by extracting files from an archive. The premise of the directory traversal vulnerability is that an attacker can gain access to parts of the file system outside of the target folder in which they should reside"

## Installation instructions for the exploit 

Run the `eviarc.py` Python script with the following parameters:

```bash
python evilarc.py -d 10 -o unix evil.sh
```

This will create an `evil.zip` file containing the exploit. 

##  Installation instructions for the target

Run the `run.sh` script to: (1) build the Maven project as the Docker image, (2) deploy the Tomcat web service and (3) run the container. For that you need  need to have installed:
- Java
- Python
- Docker
- Maven

Then upload the exploit zip file to the server. It will perform directory traversal attack to copy the `evil.sh` file in the root of the target service.
